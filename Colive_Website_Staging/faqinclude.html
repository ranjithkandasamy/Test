                    While we would love to have you continue or extend your stay with Colive, our properties
                    are usually in high demand hence postponing your move-out date would be subject to the
                    availability of your booking. If your booking is available, then you can continue staying in
                    the same room. If your room has been booked by another customer, then you will have to
                    move to the room that is allotted by the system after the check-out date. Pro-rata rent for
                    the additional days of your stay will have to be paid prior to the check-out.
